# Challenge #2 Portfolio

Version 1
Deployed 27 September 2023

## Description
In this challenge, we were tasked with making a portfolio designed to showcase our work as we move through the bootcamp coursework. As there is no real coursework as of yet, all of the elements in the Work section are placeholders and will be updated accordingly when those projects are complete. The page containes a current photograph of me, links to email me and to view my GitHub account. I have yet to establish a LinkedIn profile, so that will be linked at a later date. The links in the Nav bar all jump to their appropriate sections on the page.

## Challenges

This whole exercise was a crash course in FlexBox. I was able to establish the Header and the Subtitle areas, as well as the aside, but was totally stumped as to how to then proceed to the main body of the site. Tutor Dru Sanchez was able to talk me through the concept of adding overarching parent elements to have greater control over the child elements. With his guidance I was able to successfully place the elements within the main body.
